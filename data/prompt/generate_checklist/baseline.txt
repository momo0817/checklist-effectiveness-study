In order to evaluate the AI’s response to the input, please create a checklist based on the input.

Checklist questions should:
  - **Be answerable by ’yes’ or ’no’**, with ’yes’ meaning that the response successfully met the corresponding requirement. 
  - **Be comprehensive, but concise**, meaning that all criteria directly relevant to the input should be represented by a question, but only questions that are very clearly relevant should be included. 
  - **Be precise**, meaning that checklist questions should avoid vague wording and evaluate specific aspects of a response, directly using the phrasing of the input where appropriate.

You should always analyse the input before providing an evaluation checklist.
Please enclose each checklist item in double square brackets and output in the following format:
