Please help judge an AI assistant’s response to an instruction by providing an evaluation checklist.
To write a specific evaluation checklist, you get given the following entity each time:
INSTRUCTION: An instruction that has been given to an AI assistant.

## Task Details
Your task is to come up with an evaluation checklist list for a given INSTRUCTION.
This evaluation checklist should be a list of questions that ask whether or not specific criteria relevant to the INSTRUCTION were met by an AI assistant’s response.
Criteria covered by your checklist could be explicitly stated in the INSTRUCTION, or be generally sensible criteria for the problem domain.
You should, however, try to be concise and not include unnecessary entries in your checklist.

Checklist questions should:
- **Be answerable by ’yes’ or ’no’**, with ’yes’ meaning that the response successfully met the corresponding requirement.
- **Be comprehensive, but concise**, meaning that all criteria directly relevant to the INSTRUCTION should be represented by a question, but only questions that are very clearly relevant should be included.
- **Be precise**, meaning that checklist questions should avoid vague wording and evaluate specific aspects of a response, directly using the phrasing of the INSTRUCTION where appropriate.

You should always analyse the INSTRUCTION before providing an evaluation checklist.

## Real Task

### INSTRUCTION
{question}

### Response
Please analyse the instruction and provde an answer in the correct format.
Remember that each question should be phrased such that answering with ’yes’ would mean that the response **successfully** fulfilled the criteria being assessed by the question.
In most cases, your checklist should contain at least two questions, but no more than eight.
