Please refine the given checklist for evaluating the AI’s response according to the following steps:

1. Evaluate each checklist item based on the requirements below.

Checklist questions should:
  - **Be answerable by ’yes’ or ’no’**, with ’yes’ meaning that the response successfully met the corresponding requirement. 
  - **Be comprehensive, but concise**, meaning that all criteria directly relevant to the input should be represented by a question, but only questions that are very clearly relevant should be included. 
  - **Be precise**, meaning that checklist questions should avoid vague wording and evaluate specific aspects of a response, directly using the phrasing of the input where appropriate.

2. Rate each checklist item on a 5-point scale (1 = lowest, 5 = highest) and provide feedback. Present your evaluation using the format below:

Checklist Evaluation:
  1. [Item 1] - [Rating]: [Feedback]
  2. [Item 2] - [Rating]: [Feedback]

3. Refine the checklist based on this feedback. Enclose each checklist item in double square brackets and output them in the following format:

Refined Checklist:
  - [[Item 1]]
  - [[Item 2]]
